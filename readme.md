# **Flappy Bird AI - Neural Network-Based Evolutionary Agent**

## 📌 Introduction  
This project implements an AI agent to play a Flappy Bird-like game using **Neural Networks and Evolutionary Algorithms**. The agents learn to navigate through pipes by evolving over generations, improving their performance using **genetic algorithms**.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Develop an AI agent that learns to play Flappy Bird using **Neural Networks**.  
- Implement **evolutionary learning** for continuous improvement.  
- Simulate a **genetic algorithm** for natural selection among agents.  
- Experiment with **mutation and crossover** for better performance.  

## 🌟 Highlights  
- **AI-powered gameplay**: No human intervention needed.  
- **Neural Network-based decision-making** for flapping.  
- **Genetic Algorithm for Evolution**: Best agents survive and reproduce.  
- **Vision-based AI**: Agents "see" pipes and decide actions.  

## 🔬 Methodology  
1. **Initialize Population** → Random agents with different weights.  
2. **Vision Processing** → Agents detect pipes and obstacles.  
3. **Decision Making** → Neural Network predicts whether to flap or not.  
4. **Fitness Calculation** → Longer survival means better fitness.  
5. **Natural Selection** → Best-performing agents reproduce for the next generation.  
6. **Mutation & Evolution** → New agents inherit traits with slight mutations.  

## 🛠️ Software and Libraries Used  
- **Python** (Main language)  
- **Pygame** (For game rendering)  
- **NumPy** (For Neural Network operations)  
- **Random** (For mutations and randomness in evolution)  

## 🚀 Usage  
### 1️⃣ **Setup the Environment**  
Make sure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```
### 2️⃣ **Run the Game**  
Execute the main application:  
```bash
python app.py
```
### 3️⃣ **Observe the AI**  
Watch how the agents evolve and improve over time!  

## 🔮 Future Scope  
- Implement **Deep Reinforcement Learning** for better training.  
- Introduce **multi-layered Neural Networks** for improved decision-making.  
- Add **GUI-based visualization** of learning progress.  
- Train using **more complex environments** for better generalization.
